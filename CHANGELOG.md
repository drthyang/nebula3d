# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **In-browser low-memory mode — smaller peak, bit-identical results.** A new
  `NEBULA3D_LOW_MEMORY` mode (`nebula3d.core.low_memory`, always on in the
  Pyodide bridge) trades a little recompute for a smaller peak so full-resolution
  reductions fit the 4 GB WASM heap (Pyodide is 32-bit; there is no wasm64
  build). The ring stage drops its full-3-D |Q|/φ coordinate caches (per-plane
  2-D recompute), the flatten stage subtracts in place, and the unused per-voxel
  `sigma` is freed before the ΔPDF / back-FFT stages. **Verified byte-for-byte
  identical to the exact path on real data** — a 401×501×151 (30.3 M-voxel)
  neutron dataset gives identical backfilled / flattened / ΔPDF volumes and
  identical consistency metrics either way; the whole reduction peaks at ~2.3 GB
  (binding stage: the back-FFT consistency check, ~75 B/voxel). Separately, the
  ring-workflow `backfill_ring_shells` (not the default `q_shell` Bragg backfill)
  now bounds its all-valid-voxel KD-tree to a per-H-slab local tree in
  low-memory mode — within ~1e-5 relative of the exact fill, tested in
  `tests/test_backfill_blocked.py`. 222 tests, ruff, and mypy clean.
- **Pipeline ~22–31 % faster with bit-identical outputs.** Browser audit +
  performance pass (see
  [docs/reports/2026-07-02_browser_audit_perf.md](docs/reports/2026-07-02_browser_audit_perf.md)):
  HDF5 stage outputs now use gzip-1 + byte-shuffle (lossless, ~8 % smaller,
  ~2.6× faster writes), consecutive pipeline stages hand volumes over in
  memory instead of re-reading compressed HDF5 (artifacts and resume
  behaviour unchanged), and the ring-removal texture fit solves its per-|Q|
  ridge systems in one stacked LAPACK call. Every stage artifact verified
  SHA-256-identical before/after at two volume sizes, serial and parallel;
  219 tests, ruff, and mypy clean; in-browser end-to-end run verified
  (6/6 stages, consistency r = 0.99963, no console errors).
- **Milestone: fully static, GitHub Pages-hosted app with feature parity.** The
  browser console now runs the **complete** `nebula3d` reduction — every pipeline
  stage, cleanup, 3D-ΔPDF, multi-volume, and consistency view — entirely
  client-side via Pyodide, at **full-resolution float64** (up to ~50 M voxels;
  a 301×401×401 volume fits). No server, no upload, no install: the app is a
  static bundle served from **https://drthyang.github.io/nebula3d/**, deployed by
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml` on push to `main`. The in-browser build is now a
  first-class path alongside the native `nebula3d-web` backend, not a reduced
  demo. Under Pyodide (no OS threads) ring removal falls back to serial slice
  processing; native CPython still parallelises.
- **Spherical-frame Bragg punch.** The default punch ellipsoid axes now follow
  the local spherical frame at each peak — `(rρ, rθ, rφ)` in Å⁻¹ with rρ radial
  (along Q̂), rφ azimuthal (a*–b* ring tangent, c* pole), rθ polar — so every
  reflection is oriented correctly with no tilt angle. Added
  `punch_frame="spherical"` (now the `PunchParams` / web default) alongside the
  existing `"q"` (a*/b*/c*) and `"hkl"` frames; the legacy frames are unchanged.
  Configure and Bragg-profile pages gain a frame selector and rρ/rθ/rφ controls,
  and the punch preview renders the per-peak oriented ellipse.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-06-18

- Promoted the consistency check to the endpoint of the recommended 3D-DeltaPDF
  workflow.
- Added the FastAPI/React consistency viewer and `/api/consistency` endpoints
  for reciprocal-space back-FFT comparison with optional `|Q|` and real-space
  bands.
- Updated `examples/run_pipeline.py` to run the back-FFT consistency check by
  default after the DeltaPDF stage.
- Updated documentation around the full workflow, web UI, reproducibility
  commands, and output artifacts.
- Aligned package, API, and web app version metadata at `0.2.0`.

## 0.1.0 - Initial alpha

- Initial alpha toolkit for reciprocal-space diffuse-scattering cleanup and
  3D-DeltaPDF exploration.
