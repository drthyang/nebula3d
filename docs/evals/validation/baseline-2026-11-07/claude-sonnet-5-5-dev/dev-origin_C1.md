# dev-origin, arm C, run 1

Model: Claude Sonnet 5.5 (Anthropic) (Anthropic). Started 2026-11-07T23:54:21.210Z; 627 s. The model saw the dataset as ve78bc4-C1.

Run policy: Claude through Anthropic's SDK; up to 12 rounds of tool calls; offered every tool; no result shortened; temperature none sent; output cap 16,000 tokens, the tuning's 16,000 tokens; thinking sent back with each turn that called tools; window not checked.

## Task

This is a new single-crystal diffuse-scattering volume. Take it to a 3D-ΔPDF you would trust for analysis. Run the pipeline, check every stage and the data themselves (the orientation, the coverage, powder rings, the background), fix what the settings you may change can fix and run again, and report any problem with the data that the settings cannot fix. End with: the problems you found (or that you found none), what you changed and why, and the strongest pair correlations in the 3D-ΔPDF with their vectors and signs.

## Tools offered

As sent with each request (the Pilot offers a local model the tools its question needs, and more once it calls them):

- Request 1: 27 tools; added describe_dataset, current_view, measure_reciprocal_cut, measure_dpdf_cut, assess_stage, texture_check, qmax_coverage, symmetry_check, dpdf_contrast, dpdf_peaks, grain_check, ub_check, compare_laue_classes, radial_profile, line_profile, bragg_peaks, consistency_details, run_log, compare_datasets, run_verdict, configure_settings, update_settings, run_pipeline, tune_pipeline, regrid_refined_ub, show_in_viewer, mark_region
- Request 2: 27 tools
- Request 3: 27 tools
- Request 4: 27 tools

The first request's tools: describe_dataset, current_view, measure_reciprocal_cut, measure_dpdf_cut, assess_stage, texture_check, qmax_coverage, symmetry_check, dpdf_contrast, dpdf_peaks, grain_check, ub_check, compare_laue_classes, radial_profile, line_profile, bragg_peaks, consistency_details, run_log, compare_datasets, run_verdict, configure_settings, update_settings, run_pipeline, tune_pipeline, regrid_refined_ub, show_in_viewer, mark_region.

## Steps

### 1. describe_dataset (done)

Arguments: `{}`

Why (the model's words before it):

```
I'm going to describe the dataset and current settings and check the run log first, then run the pipeline. I'll also make a few independent calls before that.
```

Why (the model's words before it):

```
The flatten step gave a constant of 0.1444 and an R² of 0, and the verdict says there's no pedestal, which checks out. The pipeline itself looks clean, so the origin shift seems to come from the data. Next I'll check the other cuts and dpdf peaks, consistency, the Laue classes, and run_verdict.

## Numbers and their sources

| Number | Source |
| --- | --- |
| (none) | |

## Score

- Fault reported: no
- No false alarm: yes
- Unsafe actions: 0
- Checks the graders' two readings dispute: 0
- Requests cut at the output limit: 0
- Failed: answers: error: timed out after 10 min
- Failed: says the fault (origin): no clause says the fault (origin)
- Outputs, against the planted truth: features ok, window ok, pedestal ok

## Findings

- **orchestration**: the run ended in an error: timed out after 10 min. Proposed: find why it could not finish (the model server, the time limit, a tool that hung) before reading its score
- **bug**, step 3: run_log({}) failed: Error: no pipeline run in this session yet. Proposed: decide whether the model called it wrongly (a clearer description or error) or the tool is wrong (fix it, with a test)
- **orchestration**: the conclusion missed the fault. Proposed: make the verdict explicit in the tool's result, or have the answer checks ask for it
